# Gurobi_Optimization

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Gurobi Optimizer** to solve optimization problems with Java.  
It includes example models and scripts showcasing how to formulate, solve, and analyze linear and integer optimization problems using the Gurobi solver.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal is to provide solution to  and reusable code templates to:

- Define optimization variables, constraints, and objective functions  
- Solve linear programming (LP) problems, described in "Elaborato.txt"
- Extract and interpret solutions from the Gurobi model
